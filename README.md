Mr. Potatohead - This app shows Mr. Potatoheads body onscreen and you can add
his bodyparts by clicking different checkboxes. It works for Portrait and Landscape
orientation. 

Note: I have not been able to handle the checkbox state saving correctly when switching 
between portrait mode and landscape mode. So you have to first unclick a bodypart for it 
to work again.
